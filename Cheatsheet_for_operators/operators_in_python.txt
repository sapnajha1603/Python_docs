Cheat Sheet

NOT
    Operator: not
    Usage:

    python

a = True
result = not a  # result is False

OR

    Operator: or
    Usage:

    python

    a = True
    b = False
    result = a or b  # result is True

XOR

    Operator: ^ (bitwise XOR)
    Usage:

    python

    a = 5  # 0101 in binary
    b = 3  # 0011 in binary
    result = a ^ b  # result is 6 (0110 in binary)

NOR

    Operator: Not directly available, combine or and not
    Usage:

    python

    a = True
    b = False
    result = not (a or b)  # result is False

AND

    Operator: and
    Usage:

    python

    a = True
    b = False
    result = a and b  # result is False

Square

    Operator: **
    Usage:

    python

    number = 5
    result = number ** 2  # result is 25

Square Root

    Function: math.sqrt()
    Usage:

    python

    import math
    number = 25
    result = math.sqrt(number)  # result is 5.0

Power of 3

    Operator: **
    Usage:

    python

    number = 2
    result = number ** 3  # result is 8

Square Root of n

    Function: math.sqrt()
    Usage:

    python

        import math
        number = 16
        result = math.sqrt(number)  # result is 4.0

Additional Useful Operations

    Exponentiation
        Operator: ** or pow()
        Usage:

        python

    base = 2
    exponent = 3
    result = base ** exponent  # result is 8
    result = pow(base, exponent)  # result is 8

Modulus

    Operator: %
    Usage:

    python

    a = 10
    b = 3
    result = a % b  # result is 1

Floor Division

    Operator: //
    Usage:

    python

    a = 10
    b = 3
    result = a // b  # result is 3

Negation

    Operator: -
    Usage:

    python

    a = 5
    result = -a  # result is -5

Bitwise AND

    Operator: &
    Usage:

    python

    a = 5  # 0101 in binary
    b = 3  # 0011 in binary
    result = a & b  # result is 1 (0001 in binary)

Bitwise OR

    Operator: |
    Usage:

    python

    a = 5  # 0101 in binary
    b = 3  # 0011 in binary
    result = a | b  # result is 7 (0111 in binary)

Bitwise NOT

    Operator: ~
    Usage:

    python

        a = 5  # 0101 in binary
        result = ~a  # result is -6 (inverted bits)
