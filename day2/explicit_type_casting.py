a ="1"
b = "2"
# print(a+b) #This command will concatenate string a and string 2 and result in 12
'''
But what if i want to print 3, that means i want to add these 2 values but i dont want to change the type 
Then we can do the below operation using TypeCasting, means converting one data type into another 
'''
print(int(a) + int(b))
